CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /home/igor/Área de Trabalho/UFSC/Sistemas digitais embarcados/main/T2-dist/TF/build/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory c:/Users/rlvvmc/source/repos/T2-dist/TF/build where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "/home/igor/Área de Trabalho/UFSC/Sistemas digitais embarcados/main/T2-dist/TF/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "C:/Users/rlvvmc/source/repos/T2-dist/TF/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
